                    <p> I'm Lita, from Phnom Penh, Cambodia. I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, with a minor in Art History at Carleton College, MN, US.</p>
                        I am passionate about using media and technology to provide underprivileged youth with better education and opportunities. I enjoy working in a collaborative culture, and taking initiative to solve challenging problems in my community and in society.
                        I have experience working at start-ups, and non-profit organizations. I believe that I can and will create a positive change in society through my career in tech and passion for social entrepreneurship! </p>
                    <p> In my free time, I enjoy ceramics, horse-riding, painting, cooking, baking, dancing Latin dances, and bullet journaling. I am an avid traveller too! 
                        The person I am today is heavily influenced by the different places, and cultures that I engaged with through my travels.</p>

                                            <p>After graduating high school, I took a gap year and for the first 3-4 months, I got a full-ride scholarship to go to Semester at Sea, a life changing experience across 11 countries and 4 continents!
                                                I took 4 college level courses in geography, political science, economics development and finance. The best part about it was that I could apply what I learnt to the countries I visited, expanding my understanding of the world.
                                                Some of my memorable experiences are:</p>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>South Africa: Taking an independent trip to two informal settlements just at the outskirts of Cape Town, South Africa in which I learnt about the way the community functions - the council of people, the school and the wealth disparities between communities. I also met amazing strong women who helped me see so much more than just poverty - joy in living.</li>
                                                    <li>Ghana: Going to a floating village, Nzulenzu, Ghana where I learnt about the troubles, the joy and all the in-betweens. There, I made a promise to the chief that when I can help, I will go back and do my best to bring better health care and education to the people of Nzulenzu.</li>
                                                    <li>India: I loved Cochin, and the villages around it. I am happy I made the decision to not fly elsewhere within the five days I have in India and just stay in Cochin to explore the day-to-day lives of people. I was very lucky to have made a friend, Anub, a tuk-tuk driver/homestay ownwer who showed me around the fishing villages, his childhood home, his school, and Cochin's local arts and culture.</li>

                                            <p>I'm now in my third year at <a href="https://www.carleton.edu/" target="_blank">Carleton College</a>, currently taking courses in various fields:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li> Computer Science: I've particularly enjoyed learning about various algorithms and how they solve our every-day issues, and the human-computer interaction aspect of the field.</li>
                                                <li> 2D/3D Art: I have taken classes in photography, oil painting and ceramics as a way to self-expression, and to learn more about different ways we put ourselves into the world as humans.</li>
                                                <li> Art History: I believe that the arts have a beautiful way of capturing moments in history, and that art is indeed its own temporal timeline of events. I enjoy gaining new perspectives, and learning about the various art movements through the ages.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                                    <li> Member of Carleton Equestrian Team: I grew up loving horses, and have been part of the Cambodian National Equestrian team as well as Carleton equestrian team for a few years now.</li>
                                                    <li> Publicity Manager of Carleton Student Association (CSA) 2019-2020: I bridge the communication channel between the student body and the CSA members.</li>
                                                    <li> Finalist of Carleton 2019 Start Up Competition: My partner and I were chosen as one of the finalist teams and we pitched. Check the pitch out here!</li>
                                                    <li> Student Assistant & Blogger at Carleton Office of Admissions: I talk to prospective domestic and international students in fairs/events about my life at Carleton - academic and non-academic so that they can get an insight into the college.
